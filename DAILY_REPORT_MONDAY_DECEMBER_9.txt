Frontend Development - Kokokah.com LMS
(User Dashboard & Enrollment Features Implementation)

I focused on implementing critical frontend features for the Kokokah.com LMS user
interface. The following features were implemented:

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

I implemented the User Dashboard page (resources/views/users/usersdashboard.blade.php)
with dynamic user profile loading via UserApiClient, displaying user name, email,
profile picture, and account status with real-time data from the backend API.

I implemented dynamic enrollment loading on the dashboard showing all enrolled courses
with course titles, progress bars, completion percentages, and instructor information
fetched from EnrollmentApiClient.

I implemented stats cards on the dashboard displaying total enrolled courses, completed
courses, in-progress courses, and certificates earned with real-time calculations from
the backend.

I implemented a course carousel with "Continue Learning" section showing the user's
most recent courses with resume buttons, allowing users to quickly jump back to their
learning progress.

I implemented the Enrollment page (resources/views/users/enroll.blade.php) with dynamic
course listing from CourseApiClient, displaying all available courses with titles,
descriptions, prices, instructor names, and enrollment status.

I implemented multi-select course enrollment functionality allowing users to select
multiple courses and enroll in them simultaneously with a single API call.

I implemented real-time total price calculation on the enrollment page that updates
dynamically as users select/deselect courses, showing individual course prices and
total amount due.

I implemented an "Enroll in All" button that allows users to quickly enroll in all
available courses with a single click, with confirmation dialog for user safety.

I applied the Kokokah design system styling throughout both pages using Primary Teal
#004A53 for headers and buttons, Secondary Yellow #FDAF22 for highlights and CTAs,
Fredoka font for headings, and Inter font for body text.

I implemented loading spinners and skeleton screens while data is being fetched from
the API, providing visual feedback to users during data loading.

I implemented comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages displayed
via toast notifications when API calls fail or validation errors occur.

I implemented responsive design for both pages ensuring proper display on mobile, tablet,
and desktop devices with Bootstrap 5 grid system and media queries.
