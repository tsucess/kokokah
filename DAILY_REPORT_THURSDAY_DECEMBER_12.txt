Frontend Development - Kokokah.com LMS
(Certificate Page & Phase 1 Completion)

I focused on completing Phase 1 implementation with the Certificate page and all
supporting API clients. The following features were implemented:

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

I implemented the Certificate page (resources/views/users/certificate.blade.php) with
dynamic certificate loading from CertificateApiClient, displaying certificate details,
course information, completion date, and certificate ID.

I implemented a certificate display with professional design showing course name,
student name, completion date, instructor signature, and certificate number.

I implemented certificate download functionality allowing users to download their
certificate as a PDF file with high-quality formatting.

I implemented certificate sharing functionality allowing users to share their
certificates on social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook) with pre-filled messages.

I implemented certificate verification allowing users to verify certificate authenticity
by entering certificate ID on a verification page.

I implemented a certificates list page showing all earned certificates with thumbnails,
course names, completion dates, and download/share buttons.

I implemented certificate filtering allowing users to filter by course, date range,
and status (earned, pending, expired).

I implemented the CertificateApiClient with methods for getting certificates,
downloading certificates, verifying certificates, and sharing certificates.

I implemented the TopicApiClient with methods for getting topics, getting topic content,
and marking topics as complete.

I implemented the LessonApiClient with methods for getting lessons, getting lesson
content, marking lessons complete, and tracking lesson progress.

I implemented the QuizApiClient with methods for getting quizzes, submitting quiz
answers, getting quiz results, and tracking quiz attempts.

assignments, getting submissions, and getting grades.

I implemented the ProgressApiClient with methods for getting progress, updating
progress, getting achievements, and generating progress reports.

I implemented the EnrollmentApiClient with methods for getting enrollments, enrolling
in courses, getting enrollment details, and updating enrollment progress.

profile, getting user achievements, and getting user learning statistics.
