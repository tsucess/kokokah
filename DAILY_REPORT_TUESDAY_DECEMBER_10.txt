Frontend Development - Kokokah.com LMS
(Lesson Viewer & Quiz Interface Implementation)

I focused on implementing critical learning content pages for the Kokokah.com LMS.
The following features were implemented:

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

I implemented the Lesson Viewer page (resources/views/users/lesson.blade.php) with
dynamic lesson content loading from LessonApiClient, displaying lesson title,
description, instructor information, and lesson metadata.

I implemented multi-format content support in the Lesson Viewer allowing display of
5 content types: Text content with rich formatting, Video content with embedded player,
Audio content with audio player controls, Document content with PDF viewer, and Image
content with lightbox gallery.

I implemented a video player component using HTML5 video element with custom controls
including play/pause, volume control, fullscreen mode, and playback speed adjustment.

I implemented an audio player component with play/pause controls, progress bar, volume
control, and duration display for audio lessons.

I implemented a document viewer for PDF files with page navigation, zoom controls, and
download functionality.

I implemented an image gallery with lightbox functionality allowing users to view lesson
images in full screen with navigation between multiple images.

I implemented a progress tracking system that automatically marks lessons as complete
when users finish viewing content, updating progress via ProgressApiClient.

I implemented the Quiz Interface page (resources/views/users/quiz.blade.php) with
dynamic quiz loading from QuizApiClient, displaying quiz title, description, and
instructions.

I implemented a quiz timer that counts down from the quiz duration, displaying remaining
time prominently and warning users when time is running out.

I implemented question rendering with support for multiple question types: Multiple
choice, True/False, Short answer, and Essay questions.

I implemented answer selection functionality allowing users to select answers, with
visual feedback showing selected options and ability to change answers before submission.

I implemented quiz submission with automatic scoring for objective questions (multiple
choice, true/false) and submission of essay answers for manual grading.

I implemented quiz results page showing score, percentage, correct/incorrect answers,
and detailed feedback for each question.

I implemented lesson navigation allowing users to move between lessons in a course with
previous/next buttons and lesson list sidebar.

I implemented lesson completion tracking showing which lessons are completed, in-progress,
and not started with visual indicators.

I applied the Kokokah design system throughout both pages with consistent colors,
typography, spacing, and component styles.
