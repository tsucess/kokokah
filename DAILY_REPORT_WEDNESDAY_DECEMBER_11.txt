Frontend Development - Kokokah.com LMS
(Assignment Submission & Progress Tracker Implementation)

I focused on implementing assignment and progress tracking features for the Kokokah.com
LMS. The following features were implemented:

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

I implemented the Assignment Submission page (resources/views/users/assignment.blade.php)
with dynamic assignment loading from AssignmentApiClient, displaying assignment title,
description, due date, instructions, and submission requirements.

I implemented file upload functionality allowing users to upload assignment files with
support for multiple file types (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, images) with file size validation.

I implemented a rich text editor for text-based assignments allowing users to write and
format their responses with bold, italic, underline, lists, and code formatting.

I implemented assignment submission with automatic timestamp recording and submission
status tracking (submitted, pending review, graded).

I implemented submission history showing all previous submissions with timestamps, file
names, and submission status.

I implemented grade display showing assignment grades, feedback from instructors, and
rubric scoring when available.

I implemented the Progress Tracker page (resources/views/users/progress.blade.php) with
dynamic progress data loading from ProgressApiClient, displaying overall course progress
and detailed lesson-by-lesson progress.

I implemented a progress bar showing overall course completion percentage with visual
indicators for completed, in-progress, and not-started lessons.

I implemented a detailed progress table showing each lesson with completion status,
time spent, quiz scores, and assignment grades.

I implemented progress statistics showing total lessons, completed lessons, average quiz
score, and estimated completion date.

I implemented a learning timeline showing the user's learning journey with milestones,
achievements, and completion dates.

I implemented achievement badges showing earned badges, certificates, and skill
endorsements with descriptions and dates earned.

I implemented a download progress report feature allowing users to download their
progress as a PDF file with detailed statistics and achievements.

I implemented progress filtering allowing users to filter by course, date range, and
status (completed, in-progress, not started).

I applied the Kokokah design system throughout both pages with consistent colors,
typography, spacing, and component styles.

I implemented responsive design for both pages ensuring proper display on mobile, tablet,
and desktop devices.
