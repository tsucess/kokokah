Daily Work Report / Taofeeq Ogunsanya / Software Development / 12/12/2025



Greetings Mr. Paul,
Below is my work report for the day,

Tasks

Web Monitoring and Software Development on Kokokah LMS (Profile Functionality Verification & Testing)

I focused on comprehensive testing and verification of all profile page functionality to ensure quality and reliability. The following tasks were completed:

I VERIFIED the profile photo upload functionality works correctly with optimized image compression and file size validation.

I TESTED the image cropping feature with zoom, rotate, and reset controls to ensure proper functionality.

I VERIFIED the account deletion confirmation modal displays correctly and requires email confirmation before deletion.

I TESTED the password change functionality to ensure users can securely update their passwords with proper validation.

I VERIFIED the profile data loading from the API displays correctly in all form fields.

I TESTED the profile data saving functionality to ensure all fields are properly saved to the database.

I VERIFIED the parent information management system allows students to add and update parent/guardian details.

I TESTED the form validation to ensure all required fields are validated and error messages display correctly.

I VERIFIED the role-based profile routing correctly directs students to /userprofile and admins to /adminprofile.

I TESTED the token-based authentication to ensure Bearer tokens are properly sent with API requests.

I VERIFIED the error handling displays appropriate messages to users when validation or API errors occur.

I CLEARED Laravel caches and compiled views to ensure all changes are properly deployed.

I TESTED the complete profile workflow from login to profile update to account deletion.

I'm currently ready to implement the remaining user views (announcements, koodies, leaderboard) and add comprehensive unit tests for profile functionality.
