Daily Work Report / Taofeeq Ogunsanya / Software Development / 10/12/2025



Greetings Mr. Paul,
Below is my work report for the day,

Tasks

Web Monitoring and Software Development on Kokokah LMS (Profile Page Implementation & Authentication)

I focused on implementing a complete profile page system with role-based routing, user authentication, and account management features. The following tasks were completed:

I IMPLEMENTED the role-based profile page navigation system that routes students to /userprofile and admins to /adminprofile based on their role stored in localStorage.

I IMPLEMENTED simple web routes (/adminprofile and /userprofile) that return profile views without middleware, allowing API-based authentication via Bearer tokens.

I MODIFIED dashboard.js to check authentication status and route users to the appropriate profile page based on their role.

I IMPLEMENTED profile data loading functionality using UserApiClient API with Bearer token authentication in the Authorization header.

I FIXED the Blade template structure by adding missing <main> opening tags in both usertemplate.blade.php and dashboardtemp.blade.php that were causing "Cannot end a section without first starting one" errors.

I IMPLEMENTED the account deletion feature with a professional confirmation modal that requires users to confirm their email before deleting their account.

I ADDED the confirmationModal.js script to usertemplate.blade.php to provide the account deletion confirmation modal functionality.

I UNIFIED the user profile implementation with the admin profile implementation, ensuring both profiles have identical functionality while maintaining their respective layouts.

I FIXED the profile update validation by adding missing validation rules for parent_first_name, parent_last_name, parent_email, and parent_phone fields in the UserController.

I OPTIMIZED the profile photo upload by reducing image dimensions from 4096x4096 to 800x800 pixels and converting from PNG to JPEG format with 0.8 quality, reducing file size from 10MB to 50-100KB.

I ADDED comprehensive error handling and logging to display validation errors to users and log them to Laravel logs for debugging.

I VERIFIED profile data loading, saving, and account deletion functionality through comprehensive testing.

I'm currently ready to implement additional profile features and add comprehensive unit tests for profile functionality.
