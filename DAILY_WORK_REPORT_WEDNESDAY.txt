Daily Work Report / Taofeeq Ogunsanya / Software Development / 11/12/2025



Greetings Mr. Paul,
Below is my work report for the day,

Tasks

Web Monitoring and Software Development on Kokokah LMS (Frontend Navigation & Template Enhancement)

I focused on enhancing the frontend navigation system and improving the user template structure for better user experience. The following tasks were completed:

I ADDED new navigation routes to web.php for upcoming student features including /userannouncement, /userkoodies, and /userleaderboard.

I CREATED the route handlers that return the corresponding views (users.userannouncement, users.userkoodies, users.leaderboard) for student navigation.

I ENHANCED the usertemplate.blade.php navigation structure with improved sidebar navigation menu items.

I ADDED new menu items for announcements, koodies, and leaderboard features to the student dashboard navigation.

I IMPROVED the responsive design of the usertemplate.blade.php for better mobile device support.

I UPDATED the navigation styling to match the Kokokah design system with proper color scheme and typography.

I VERIFIED that all navigation links are properly connected to their respective routes and views.

I TESTED the navigation functionality to ensure all links work correctly and route to the appropriate pages.

I ENSURED backward compatibility with existing profile page functionality while adding new navigation features.

I OPTIMIZED the template structure for better performance and maintainability.

I'm currently ready to implement the actual content views for announcements, koodies, and leaderboard pages.
