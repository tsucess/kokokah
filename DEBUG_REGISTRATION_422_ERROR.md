# üîç Debug Registration 422 Error

## ‚úÖ API Works Perfectly!

I tested the API directly and it works:
```
POST /api/register with valid data ‚Üí 201 Created ‚úÖ
```

**This means the issue is with the FRONTEND form submission, not the backend.**

## üß™ How to Debug

### Step 1: Hard Refresh Browser
- Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Step 2: Open DevTools
- Press `F12`
- Go to **Console** tab

### Step 3: Fill the Form
- First Name: `John`
- Last Name: `Doe`
- Email: `john.test@example.com`
- Password: `Password123!`
- Role: `Student`

### Step 4: Submit the Form
- Click "Sign Up"
- Watch the Console tab

### Step 5: Check Console Output

You should see:
```javascript
Form Data: {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "john.test@example.com",
  password: "Password123!",
  role: "student"
}

Calling API with: {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "john.test@example.com",
  password: "Password123!",
  role: "student"
}

API Response: {
  success: false,
  message: "...",
  error: {...}
}
```

## üîç What to Look For

### If you see "Please fill in all fields"
- One of the form fields is empty
- Check that you filled in ALL fields including Role

### If you see validation error in API Response
- The error message will tell you which field failed
- Example: "The email has already been taken."

### If you see network error
- Check that the server is running
- Check that you can access http://localhost:8000

## üìã Common Issues

### Issue 1: Role field is empty
**Problem**: The role dropdown shows "-- Select Role --" but you didn't select a role
**Solution**: Make sure to select "Student" or "Instructor"

### Issue 2: Email already exists
**Problem**: You're trying to register with an email that's already registered
**Solution**: Use a different email address

### Issue 3: Password too short
**Problem**: Password is less than 8 characters
**Solution**: Use a password with at least 8 characters

### Issue 4: Invalid name format
**Problem**: First/Last name contains invalid characters
**Solution**: Use only letters, spaces, hyphens, or apostrophes

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Open Console (F12)
3. Fill the form with test data
4. Submit the form
5. **Copy the entire console output and share it with me**
6. I'll be able to see exactly what's happening

## üìù Test Data

Use this exact data for testing:
```
First Name: John
Last Name: Doe
Email: john.test@example.com (or any unique email)
