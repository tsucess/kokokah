## üîß What Was Fixed

### Issue
The registration was working, but the email verification notification wasn't being sent with the custom verification code.

### Solution
Added custom `sendEmailVerificationNotification()` method to the User model that:
1. Creates a 6-digit verification code
2. Sends it via email using `VerificationCodeNotification`
3. Code expires in 15 minutes
4. User can enter code on verify-email page

### Files Modified
- **`app/Models/User.php`**
  - Added import for `VerificationCodeNotification`
  - Added custom `sendEmailVerificationNotification()` method
