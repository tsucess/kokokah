# ✅ FIXED: 500 Internal Server Error - Missing verification_codes Table

## 🔴 Problem
Registration was failing with a **500 (Internal Server Error)** when trying to send verification email.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `verification_codes` table didn't exist in the database. The migration file was created but never executed.

**Error Message:**
```
SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 
Table 'kokokah.verification_codes' doesn't exist
```

## ✅ Solution
Ran the database migration to create the `verification_codes` table:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

**Result:**
```
2025_10_26_000000_create_verification_codes_table ..... 376.09ms DONE
```

## 📊 What Was Created

### verification_codes Table
The migration created a table with the following columns:
- `id` - Primary key
- `user_id` - Foreign key to users table
- `code` - 6-digit verification code
- `type` - Type of verification (email, phone, password_reset)
- `expires_at` - When the code expires
- `used_at` - When the code was used
- `attempts` - Number of failed attempts
- `max_attempts` - Maximum allowed attempts (5)
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `updated_at` - Timestamp

## 🚀 What Now Works

✅ User registration  
✅ Verification code generation  
✅ Email sending with code  
✅ Success notification (GREEN)  
✅ Redirect to verify-email page  
✅ Email verification with code
