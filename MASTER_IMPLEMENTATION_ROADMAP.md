- Write model tests
- Write critical controller tests
- Set up CI/CD

**Why First?**
- Ensures existing code is stable
- Catches bugs before adding features
- Provides safety net for other changes
- Builds testing culture

### **Tier 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-6)**
**Then Advanced Analytics** - High business value
- Implement predictive models
- Add cohort analysis
- Create engagement scoring
- Build custom dashboards

**Why Second?**
- Builds on stable foundation
- Provides business insights
- Relatively independent feature
- Can be done in parallel with other work

### **Tier 3: User Experience (Weeks 7-10)**
**Then Internationalization** - Expand market reach
- Add multi-language support
- Implement multi-currency
- Add timezone support
- Localize content

**Why Third?**
- Enables African expansion
- Relatively independent
- Can be done incrementally
- High market impact

### **Tier 4: Performance (Weeks 11-14)**
**Then Video Streaming** - Optimize content delivery
- Implement HLS/DASH
- Set up CDN
- Add video analytics
- Enable offline download

**Why Fourth?**
- Requires stable infrastructure
- Benefits from i18n (multi-region)
- Performance-critical
- Can be done incrementally

### **Tier 5: Real-time (Weeks 15-18)**
**Finally Real-time Features** - Advanced engagement
- Set up WebSocket server
- Implement real-time notifications
- Build live chat
- Add presence indicators

**Why Last?**
- Most complex feature
- Requires all others stable
- Highest infrastructure needs
- Can be done incrementally

## üìä Timeline Summary

```
Week 1-2:   Test Coverage (Foundation)
Week 3-6:   Advanced Analytics (Core)
Week 7-10:  Internationalization (Expansion)
Week 11-14: Video Streaming (Performance)
Week 15-18: Real-time Features (Engagement)

Total: 18 weeks (4.5 months) for all 5 improvements
```

## üöÄ Parallel Work Opportunities

**Can be done in parallel:**
- Analytics + Internationalization (Weeks 3-10)
- Video Streaming + Real-time (Weeks 11-18)
- Tests can be written throughout

**Recommended parallel approach:**
- Week 1-2: Test Coverage (1 developer)
- Week 3-10: Analytics (1 dev) + i18n (1 dev)
- Week 11-18: Video (1 dev) + Real-time (1 dev)

**With 2 developers:** 9 weeks total
**With 4 developers:** 5-6 weeks total
