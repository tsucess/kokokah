# ⚡ Quick Fix Reference - CSP Error

## 🐛 Error You Were Getting

```
Refused to load the script 'http://[::1]:5173/resources/js/app.js' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Updated `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeadersMiddleware.php` to allow Vite dev server in local development.

## 🔧 The Fix (One Line Summary)

Added Vite dev server URLs to CSP headers **only in local environment**.

## 📋 What Changed

### File: `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeadersMiddleware.php`

**Lines 39, 40, 44 were updated to include:**
```
(app()->environment('local') ? " http://localhost:5173 http://[::1]:5173 ws://localhost:5173 ws://[::1]:5173" : "")
```

This means:
- ✅ In `local` environment: Allow Vite dev server
- ✅ In `production` environment: Keep strict CSP (no Vite URLs)

## 🚀 What to Do Now

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check the console** - No more CSP errors
3. **Verify the page loads** - Everything should work

## 🔍 How to Verify the Fix

### Option 1: Check Console
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- No red CSP errors should appear

### Option 2: Check Network Tab
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Refresh page
- Look for `app.js` request
- Should show status 200 (not blocked)

### Option 3: Check Response Headers
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Click on the page request
- Go to Response Headers
- Find `Content-Security-Policy` header
- Should include `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ **Local Development:** Vite dev server is allowed
- ✅ **Production:** Vite URLs are NOT included (strict CSP)
- ✅ **Safe:** Only affects local development

## 📝 Environment Check

Make sure your `.env` has:
```
APP_ENV=local
```

## 🎯 Result

After the fix:
- ✅ Vite dev server loads scripts
- ✅ No CSP violations
- ✅ Hot Module Replacement works
- ✅ Development is smooth

## 💡 If Issues Persist

1. **Clear browser cache:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. **Clear Laravel cache:** `php artisan cache:clear`
3. **Restart Vite:** Stop and run `npm run dev` again
4. **Restart Laravel:** Stop and run `php artisan serve` again
