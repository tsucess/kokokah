## 🛣️ API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints (No Authentication)
```
POST /api/email/send-verification-code
POST /api/email/verify-with-code
POST /api/email/resend-verification-code
```

### Authenticated Endpoints (Bearer Token)
```
POST /api/email/send-code
POST /api/email/verify-code
POST /api/email/resend-code
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User requests code**
   - POST `/api/email/send-verification-code`
   - System generates 6-character code
   - Code stored with 15-min expiration
   - Email sent to user

2. **User enters code**
   - POST `/api/email/verify-with-code`
   - System validates code
   - Checks expiration, attempts, validity

3. **Verification complete**
   - If valid: Email marked as verified
   - If invalid: Attempt counter incremented
   - If max attempts: 429 status returned
