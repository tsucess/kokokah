## 🔧 **FINAL 3 FIXES APPLIED**

### **Fix 1: My Courses Endpoint (404 → 200) ✅**
- **Problem:** Route conflict - `/courses/my-courses` was being caught by `/courses/{id}` route
- **Root Cause:** Public route `/courses/{id}` was defined before authenticated `/courses/my-courses`
- **Solution:** Moved `/courses/my-courses` route before the `{id}` route and added proper authentication middleware
- **Result:** Endpoint now returns 200 with user's enrolled courses

### **Fix 2: Student Dashboard Endpoint (500 → 200) ✅**
- **Problem:** "Unknown column 'issued_at' in 'order clause'" error
- **Root Cause:** Another reference to `issued_at` column in `getRecentAchievements()` method
- **Solution:** Changed `orderBy('issued_at')` to `orderBy('created_at')` and added null checks
- **Result:** Endpoint now returns 200 with complete dashboard data

### **Fix 3: Certificate Templates Endpoint (403 → 200) ✅**
- **Problem:** Test was using student token for admin-only endpoint
- **Root Cause:** Test configuration error - using wrong authentication token
- **Solution:** Updated test to use admin token for admin-only endpoints
- **Result:** Endpoint correctly returns 200 for admin users and 403 for students
