## 🎯 How It Works

### Flow Diagram

```
1. User requests verification code
   ↓
2. POST /api/email/send-verification-code
   ↓
3. System generates 6-character code
   ↓
4. Code stored in database with 15-min expiration
   ↓
5. Email sent to user with code
   ↓
6. User enters code in verification page
   ↓
7. POST /api/email/verify-with-code
   ↓
8. System validates code (checks expiration, attempts)
   ↓
9. If valid: Email marked as verified, code marked as used
   ↓
10. If invalid: Attempt counter incremented
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Database Configuration
```bash
# Update .env with database credentials
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=kokokah
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### 2. Run Migration
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 3. Test Endpoints

**Send Code:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/email/send-verification-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com"}'
```

**Verify Code:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/email/verify-with-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","code":"ABC123"}'
```

**Resend Code:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/email/resend-verification-code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com"}'
```

### 4. Frontend Integration
Integrate the verification code endpoints with your frontend verification page.

### 5. Production Deployment
Follow the deployment checklist in `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
