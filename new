Daily Work Report / Taofeeq Ogunsanya / Software Development / 9-12/12/2025



Greetings Mr. Paul,
Below is my work report for the days,

Tasks

Web Monitoring and Software Development on Kokokah LMS (Profile Page Implementation & User Authentication)

I focused on implementing a complete profile page system with role-based routing and user authentication. The following tasks were completed:

I IMPLEMENTED the role-based profile page navigation system that routes students to /userprofile and admins to /adminprofile based on their role stored in localStorage.

I IMPLEMENTED the profile data loading functionality using UserApiClient API with Bearer token authentication, ensuring secure data retrieval from the backend.

I IMPLEMENTED the account deletion feature with a professional confirmation modal that requires users to confirm their email before deleting their account.

I IMPLEMENTED the profile photo upload system with image cropping functionality using Cropper.js library with zoom, rotate, and reset controls.

I IMPLEMENTED the password change functionality allowing users to securely update their passwords with validation and error handling.

I IMPLEMENTED the parent information management system allowing students to add and update parent/guardian details in their profile.

I FIXED the Blade template structure by adding missing <main> opening tags in both usertemplate.blade.php and dashboardtemp.blade.php that were causing "Cannot end a section without first starting one" errors.

I FIXED the profile update validation by adding missing validation rules for parent_first_name, parent_last_name, parent_email, and parent_phone fields in the UserController.

I OPTIMIZED the profile photo upload by reducing image dimensions from 4096x4096 to 800x800 pixels and converting from PNG to JPEG format with 0.8 quality, reducing file size from 10MB to 50-100KB.

I ADDED comprehensive error handling and logging to display validation errors to users and log them to Laravel logs for debugging.

I ADDED the confirmationModal.js script to usertemplate.blade.php to provide the account deletion confirmation modal functionality.

I UNIFIED the user profile implementation with the admin profile implementation, ensuring both profiles have identical functionality while maintaining their respective layouts.

I ADDED new navigation routes (/userannouncement, /userkoodies, /userleaderboard) to web.php for upcoming student features.

I ENHANCED the usertemplate.blade.php navigation structure with improved sidebar navigation and responsive design for mobile devices.

I VERIFIED all profile functionality including data loading, saving, image upload, password change, and account deletion through comprehensive testing.

I'm currently ready to implement the remaining user views (announcements, koodies, leaderboard) and add comprehensive unit tests for profile functionality.
